Our search qury earlier was recipes using ----. The problem was that it was giving me a 
lot of options rather than the specific html recipe parsing page.

Changed the query to be step by step recipes using ---. This gave the desired results. 

Also, customized the websites to search in their /recipe directory only while doing this.

Explored the various options for the info retrieval including the findparent, findchild etc
