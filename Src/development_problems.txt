Our search qury earlier was recipes using ----. The problem was that it was giving me a 
lot of options rather than the specific html recipe parsing page.

Changed the query to be step by step recipes using ---. This gave the desired results. 

Also, customized the websites to search in their /recipe directory only while doing this.

Explored the various options for the info retrieval including the findparent, findchild etc


One of the major problems was figuring out what kind of data structure to pass to the template
After lot of thought, I passed a list of dictionary to the home.html to achieve
the desired result.

I had to make a list as I could have duplicate key values and also then I used Ordereddict
as the order of the keys was getting changed again and again.   

So, I had a list of dictionary which with dish, ingredient etc as the key string and the
list/dictionary as its value.
